potential theme ideas
  Deeper and deeper
    hacknslash: multilevel dungeon hades ripoff
    downwell
  Leave something behind
    hacknslash: weapons are trails of dangerous material that you and enemies leave behind
  Parasite
    radioactive worm storm 2
  Shelter
    kingdom perspective hacknslash hades clone where occassionally evil hail falls and tries to murder you
      hiding under shelter prevents the hail from spawning enemies
  Expansion
    hacknslash: food theme, every time you pick up an item (food) you get bigger
    hacknslash: wave-based: arena gets bigger each round
  Hidden world
    hacknslash: titanfall 2 time shenanigans, two arenas you swap between
  Delivery
    fantasy paper delivery lad
    hacknslash: literal greek marathon
    qwop
  You are the power source
    hacknslash: game speed is always scaled to your health
  Generations
    hacknslash: rogue legacy
    hacknslash: generation after generation, resist the siege
      your abilities decay, but you get new ones
  One tool, many uses
    as in, you can use each weapon many times? seems lame
    hacknslash: paradigm shift: this game is all about switching to the old man and kicking everything's butt
  Automation
    radioactive worm storm 2
    hacknslash: robot putting yourself back together?
    hacknslash: robot building other robots to fight for you?
  Lost signal
  One time use
    hacknslash: all weapons break immediately
  Containment
    hacknslash: tower defense / wave based battles
      day after day, resist the siege
      wave-by-wave challenges
      unlocking initial loadouts
  Split in two
    hacknslash: whenever you take damage, split into multiple characters that all use the same input
  Summoning
    hacknslash: summon minions, fight other summoners
